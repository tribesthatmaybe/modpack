  We go into the bunker in five days. Things have been getting rough out there in the surrounding villages with everyone panicing. I don't even think this virus thing is real, but that's not stopping the come from aways from ravaging settlements. Instead of getting mixed up between them and the locals we decided to hide out until this all passes. We have enough provisions to last us a few months or so. Hopefully those fools in the villages sort themselves out by then.
