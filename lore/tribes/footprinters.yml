  Footprinters think they are going to live here for ever, taking the easy but shortsighted route of releasing sunk carbon as a means of hanessing energy. They are not overlly aggressive to most of those who inhabit the Block Rock Desert, but they do try and impress the Come From Aways. They are likely to be aggressive towards you. They are not particularily fond of travellers or party kids, seeing them as resource leeches.
