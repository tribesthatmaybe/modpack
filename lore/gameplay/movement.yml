  You have probably figured out the movement basics by now. Looking around is done by moving the mouse around. The default keybindings are
  W - move forward
  S - move backwards
  A - move to the left
  D - move to the right
  You use "space" to jump, "left shift" to duck, and you can sprint for brief periods of time with CTRL. Careful when doing this as once you start getting thirsty, being more active will rapidly get you to the point of dehydration. If you find yourself using "creative mode" flight then you can take off and start flying by double tapping the space bar. Move up by using the space bar, and go down (and maybe even land) with the left shift key. Other modes of flight (such as jetpack or Flying Couch) may have different controls.
  You can go up and down ladders by walking up to them and, while continuing to hold down the W (forward) key, moving the mouse up or down. You can pause for a moment on ladders by holding the left shift key.
