  If you haven't already started questioning what decisions you made that resulted in your ending up in this stars foresaken desert, you will shortly... Or maybe not. While this won't necessarily be "easy", it should absolutely be fun.

  What is in store for you has been crafted to provide an experience akin to an artistic explosion in the desert. A pack for newbies and hardcore veterans alike, The Endless Supper Party is here to help you create art, machines, and maybe find community in a desert survival environment. Now get down in the dust and roll around a bit so you don't look so out of place.

  Welcome.
