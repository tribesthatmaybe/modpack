  There is just barely enough natural resources to survive out here in the desert. In order to create a thriving fully automated queer luxury block utopia. We are going to have to get into all kinds of growing and farm. There are food crops, although the challenge will be finding more diverse seeds. There are also resource crops which can be used to grow various forms of magical essence which can be crafted into usable items such as steel, glass, and skulls.

  Advanced post-scarcity will get you down the path of deconstructing things into their base components and then reconstituting them into whatever your little heart desires in the moment.
