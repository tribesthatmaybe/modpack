  Have you ever wanted to jump up walls like you were in a videogame? Well do we have a treat for you.
  Jump towards a wall and keep holding down the W key. Just as you are about to hit the wall press the left shift key (unless you have remapped that key in which case press whatever you changed it to). You will cling to the wall for a few moments. Keep holding down the W key and release the left shift key and should should jump off the wall. You can do a sweet little double jump by tapping space during this time as well.
  It can take some practice to get it right.
