You can wear a variety of things in this game. There is your base armor layer, a cosmetic layer, and various baubles that can be worn. Any of these items may or may not have magical or technology requirements to unlock their full potential.

When you open your inventory (default E) your armor layer is acceessible to the left of your avatar. Move items to/from there. You can get dressed more rapidly at Armor Stands, if you find or make them. In the lower right of your avatar view, there is a small chest plate icon. Click that to open your cosmetic armor layer. In the upper right of your avatar view, there is a small icon of a ring. Click on this and you can change what baubles you are wearing.
