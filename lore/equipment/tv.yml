  OK so you want to watch TV. This isn't really the right adventure for it, but at least you can pull animated GIF images into this system. Once you've placed a TV (either the classic or modern), you (or anyone - be careful here) can right click the TV and add up to three different URLs to a GIF. You can also turn the TV on and off. Only some URLs can be used, if you try to use a GIF and find it does not work, check with the server admin.

  You can also craft a TV remove to change channels and turn the TV on/off. Point the remote at the TV and right click to change channels. Shift rightclick to turn the tv on/off.
