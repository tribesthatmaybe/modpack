  The Laser Cell, in combination with GPS markers, may be used to project harmless lasers to arbitary points on the map. Right clicking with a GPS marker on a block and then placing it in one of the four slots of the Laser Cell will allow the cell to target. You can configure color and redstone control, along with some other aesthetic effects.

  Great for raves or road survey.
