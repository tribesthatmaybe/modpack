The flamethrower is great both for zombie defense and lighting wooden effigies on fire. Maximum range is sixteen blocks. It is fueled by hydrogen. You can place it in a tank of hydrogen to refill it.

It has three modes that you can switch between using the Mekanism Mode key (default M).

Combat mode damages entities and sets them on fire. Drops will be destroyed.

Heat mode will apply to items. Smelting iron, etc.

Inferno mode will light things on fire and result in blast damage for entities.
