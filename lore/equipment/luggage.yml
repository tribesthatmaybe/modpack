  This is luggage. Luggage is a (mostly) helpful creature that will follow you around, gobble up loose items in the world, and allow you to treat luggage as a chest. To place luggage in the world, simply right click where you want luggage to be. To retrieve luggage, shift right click. Luggage is pretty much invulnerable to normal damage but can get confused when you hop between dimensions using certain kinds of portals. Otherwise, luggage can move pertty quickly to catch up with you if you get too far away.
