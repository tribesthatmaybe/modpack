  The backback is great because it let's you carry more things. It may be accessed via the innventory hotbar by right clicking. You can also wear it as a bauble on your chest, and access it via a hotkey (defaults to "b").

  The backpack can be ugpraded to hold quite a bit of stuff. You do not have to empty your backpack in order to upgrade it.
