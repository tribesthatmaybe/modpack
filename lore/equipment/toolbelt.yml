  What is better than a backpack you have to dig through to find anything? A rapid-access tool belt, that's what. Wear the tool belt on the belt bauble spot.

  To put items in the tool belt, select the item in the hotbar. Press the toolbelt key (default "r") and a radial menu will open and you can select where the item goes. To retrieve an item from the tool belt, select an empty spot in your hotbar. Preess the toolbelt key again, and select the item you want from the radial menu.

  You can upgrade the toolbelt with belt pouches. They can be installed in the toolbelt for a cost of 3XP in an anvil.
