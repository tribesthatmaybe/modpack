  The watering can accelerates growth of non-inferium based plants by making time flow slightly faster in a 3x3 location around where it is being used. The watering can can be fi lled by  pointing it at a water source block. The watering can is used by right clicking on crops. You can also hold down right click.

  It's leaky, and it's not quite a sprinkler, but it'll help you in a pinch.
