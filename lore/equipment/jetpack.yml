  The jetpack is a piece of hydrogen powered equipment that you wear in your chest slot. There is also an armored version, and you can always wear whatever pretty armor you want in the cosmetic armor slot. The jetpack can be fueled in a hydrogen tank or the output slot of an electrolytic separator. The jetpack has three modes - regular, hover, and disabled. You can switch between them using Alt-M.

  In regular mode, holding down space will allow you to jet around. In hover space and shift will allow you to adjust altitude. When the jetpack is disabled, it's like you aren't wearing it.
