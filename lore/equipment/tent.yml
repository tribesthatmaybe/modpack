  The nomadic tent is a lovely piece of shelter that can be picked up, taken with you, and setup again - all without being unpacked. It can also be upgraded.

  The tent is built using various wall sections. These wall sections are then assembled into a tent. This tent can then be placed in the world (the basic tent needs a 5x5 piece of unobstructed flat land). The door will be visible, and the walls will be framed out. Using the basic tent mallet, right click on all the frames until the tent is fully assembled. You can then walk into (or right click with an empty hand) the door of your tent and decorate it however you like. To dissasemble the tent, right click on the door with the hammer. You can use the upgraded fancy Super Tent Mallet to assemble the tent in one fell whack of a hammer.

  To upgrade the tent, you will need to dissasemble it and have it in your inventory. Using combination of wall sections, and for higher level tents, special crossbeams, simply craft a new tent. You can then assemble it as you did the original tent. Contents should remain undisturbed, although things which were mounted on the walls may end up in your inventory upon entering the tent. No matter the internal size of the tent, the outside will always have the same five by five footprint.
