  The vast majority of the hand tools (weapons and armor included) you will make use of while you try and find The Endless Supper Party will be created in your Tinkers Workshop. These tools may be upgraded piece by piece, have modifiers placed on them (such as speed and durability boosts), and most importantly - be named. At this point you should consider reading the two Tinkers Books - "Materials and You" and the "Armory Addendum". You can repair them when they break so unless you end up in a particularly unfortunate set of circumstances involving lava they should be with you throughout your entire journey.

  Other tools are just hammers and wrenches. Some of them are needed to build some items, and others are needed to interact with other items in the world.
