# Structures

## Usage

Structures are managed with the [Recurrent Complex](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/recurrent-complex) mod. It allows users in creative mode to import, export, and create structures.

* `#gen <structure>` will generate the given structure (and any applicable sub structures) centered on your current location. A confirmation will be required, unless previews have been disabled.
* `#preview none` will disable previews. All imported and generated structures will be spawned immediately.
* `#preview shape` will enable a transluscent preview which you can accept with `#confirm`.
